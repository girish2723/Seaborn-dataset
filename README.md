Quick start
- What youâ€™ll get: clean CSV files ready for analysis and visualization. Each dataset comes with a short description, a suggested set of columns for plotting, and a quick guide on typical seaborn visualizations.
- Prerequisites: Python 3.8 or newer, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib. Optionally, Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for interactive exploration.
- Installation basics: install the core libraries with pip:
  - `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib`
  - If a requirements file exists, install it with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Getting started with a dataset:
  - Load the data with pandas: `df = pd.read_csv('path/to/dataset.csv')`
  - Visualize with seaborn: `sns.histplot(data=df, x='column_of_interest')`
- How to download assets from the Releases page:
  - From the Releases page, fetch the appropriate release asset for your platform. The link to the releases is provided in the repository and can be opened directly to download a file. If the asset is a CSV, simply load it with pandas; if it is a Python script or notebook, run or import it as needed.
  - The link used here points to the official releases page and should be accessed to obtain the latest data and assets.

What this repository provides
- A focused set of datasets that illustrate common data scenarios in data science and data visualization workflows.
- Datasets are stored in CSV format for broad compatibility across tools and environments.
- Each dataset is designed to be easy to load in pandas and ready for quick seaborn plots.
- Included notebooks guide you through basic and advanced visualization techniques using seaborn, with step-by-step explanations.

Why CSV and why seaborn
- CSV is widely supported and human-readable. It makes it easy to import data into notebooks, scripts, and teaching materials.
- Seaborn is a high-level visualization library built on top of matplotlib. It provides attractive default styles and complete plotting functions that work well with tidy data.
- This repository aligns with common data science teaching and demonstration needs: quick data loading, clear visuals, and reproducible workflows.

Dataset structure and best practices
- File naming: dataset names are descriptive and use singular terms or snake_case for consistency.
- Columns: each CSV uses a tidy data structure. Each row represents a single observation, and each column is a single variable.
- Data types: numeric columns use integers or floats. Categorical columns use strings. Dates are stored as ISO-like strings (YYYY-MM-DD) to ease parsing.
- Missing values: datasets may include missing values. Use pandas methods like `df.dropna()` or `df.fillna()` to clean data before plotting.
- Categorical ordering: for clear visuals, keep category order consistent across plots. Use pandas category dtype or seaborn's `order`/`hue_order` parameters.

How to use the data with seaborn
- Basic workflow:
  - Load data: `df = pd.read_csv('datasets/your_dataset.csv')`
  - Prepare data: handle missing values, convert dates, compute aggregates if needed.
  - Plot: call seaborn plotting functions such as `sns.barplot`, `sns.lineplot`, `sns.scatterplot`, `sns.boxplot`, `sns.violinplot`, or `sns.heatmap`.
- Quick example (inline code):
  - Load: `df = pd.read_csv('datasets/vacation_visits.csv')`
  - Plot a line chart: `sns.lineplot(data=df, x='date', y='visitors', hue='destination')`
  - Show: `plt.show()`
- Practical tips:
  - Use facet grids to compare multiple groups side by side: `sns.FacetGrid(df, col='region', height=4, aspect=1.2).map(sns.lineplot, 'date', 'visitors')`
  - Thematic color palettes help readability: `sns.set_palette('viridis')`
  - Use descriptive axis labels and titles: `plt.xlabel('Date')`, `plt.ylabel('Visitors')`, `plt.title('Visitors over Time by Destination')`
  - Save visuals for reports: `plt.savefig('plots/visitors_by_destination.png', bbox_inches='tight')`

Notebooks and interactive examples
- Notebooks provide guided demos that illustrate the data and plotting steps.
- Typical notebook contents:
  - Importing libraries and loading datasets
  - Cleaning and preprocessing steps
  - Exploratory data analysis with seaborn
  - Visual storytelling with clean visuals
  - Exporting figures for inclusion in reports
- How to run notebooks locally:
  - Install Jupyter: `pip install notebook` or `pip install jupyterlab`
  - Start server: `jupyter notebook`
  - Open the notebook file from the browser and run cells in order
- Notebook organization:
  - notebooks/basic_visualization.ipynb
  - notebooks/time_series_examples.ipynb
  - notebooks/categorical_plots.ipynb
  - notebooks/advanced_visualization.ipynb
- Practical notebook tips:
  - Use `%matplotlib inline` for inline plotting in Jupyter
  - Keep figure sizes consistent: `plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))`
  - Annotate plots for clarity: titles, axis labels, and legends
- Reproducibility:
  - Capture exact data versions with library pinning
  - Use virtual environments or conda environments to reproduce results
  - Consider writing a requirements.txt with pinned versions

Data quality, provenance, and licensing
- Data quality:
  - Each dataset includes a brief data quality note describing potential issues (missing values, outliers, inconsistent categories).
  - Users can inspect data types and basic statistics with `df.info()` and `df.describe(include='all')`.
- Provenance:
  - The datasets are curated to reflect common data patterns used in seaborn demos.
  - Some datasets are synthetic, created to illustrate plotting techniques and storytelling through visuals.
